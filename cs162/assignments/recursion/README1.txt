Description: Welcome to the recursion fractal workshop! This is a progrm that prints out a
    fractal pattern recursively! We will take in a few numbers from our user and and then 
    print out a cross like pattern using asteriks (*). In the context of computer science,
    a using a function recursively means that within our function, our function calls itself
    over and over again until it reaches what we call a base case which then either returns 
    a value or exits the function. 


Instructons: In order to use this program, we must insure that we are in the correct file 
    directory. In your terminal, enter "ls", this should list the files in your directory, 
    if assign5.zip is not in there, you will either need to download the zip file or find 
    the directory where assign5.zip is located. Once you are in the directory enter 
    "unzip assign5.zip" to unzip the zip file containing the file for this program. 
    Once unzipped, compile the program by entering "g++ -std=c++11 recursive_fractal.cpp" 
    in to the terminal, once compiled enter "./a.out" in the terminal to run the program. 

    You will be prompted with the following:
    "How many asteriks would you want to print out? (odd, positive number): "
    "How many blank spaces in front of the asteriks would you want to print out? (positive number):"

    Follow the instructions in parenthesis, then a fractal pattern will be printed out! 

Limitations: The program cannot take in any non-positive or even integers for any 'n' input
    The program also cannot take in any non-positive integers for 'col' input

Special note: In the int main part of this program I commented out a section that will print
    out the exact pattern as on the assignment
