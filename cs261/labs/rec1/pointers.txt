1: a = 0x7ffe9257f1d0, b = 0x11a1010, c = 0x4007ed
    a. In this printf statement we only wanted to print out the variables
        a, b, and c. Since all of these values are pointers, we ended up printing out
        the memory addresses.
    b. Memory addresses
        a = 0x7ffe9257f1d0 
        b = 0x11a1010
        c = 0x4007ed
    c. There are currently no contents in any of a, b, or, c

2: a[0] = 200, a[1] = 101, a[2] = 102, a[3] = 103
    a. In this printf statement, prior to printing out our c pointer got the a pointer
        pointing to an array of size 4. We utilized a for loop to assign values to each
        index in our array. However, at the end we changed the value of the first index from 
        100 to 200.
    b. Memory Addresses
        a = 0x7ffe9257f1d0
        b = 0x11a1010
        c = 0x7ffe9257f1d0 
    c. Contents
        a contains an array of size 4 with the values of 200, 101, 102, and 103
        b is empty
        c points to whatever a contains
3: a[0] = 200, a[1] = 300, a[2] = 301, a[3] = 302
    a. In this printf statement, we traverse to the first index in the array and change it to 300
        then we traverse to index 2 in the array and assign 301 to it and then we go to the third
        index in the array and assign it the value 302
    b. Memory Address
        a = 0x7ffe9257f1d0
        b = 0x11a1010
        c = 0x7ffe9257f1d0 
    c. Contents
        a contains the array
        b is empty
        c contains the same array
4: a[0] = 200, a[1] = 400, a[2] = 301, a[3] = 302
    a. In this printf statement we assign the c pointer to point to the first index in the array
        Then we change the value contained in our c pointer to 400
    b. Memory Address
        a = 0x7ffe9257f1d0
        b = 0x11a1010
        c = 0x7ffe9257f1d4  
    c. Contents
        a contins the array 
        b is empty 
        c points to the first value in the array
5: a[0] = 200, a[1] = 128144, a[2] = 256, a[3] = 302
    a. In this printf statement we turn the c int pointer to a char pointer at the first index
        then we assign the first index the value of 500
    b. Memory Address
        a = 0x7ffe9257f1d0
        b = 0x11a1010
        c = 0x7ffe9257f1d5 
    c. Contents
        a has the array
        b is empty 
        c is a char pointer to the 1st index in the array
6: a = 0x7ffe9257f1d0, b = 0x7ffe9257f1d4, c = 0x7ffe9257f1d1
    a. In this printf statement we assgin our b pointer to an int pointer to the first index in a
    b. Memory Address
        a = 0x7ffe9257f1d0
        b = 0x7ffe9257f1d4
        c = 0x7ffe9257f1d1
    c. Contents
        a still contains the array 
        b gets the pointer to the first index 
        c is a char pointer to the 1st index in the array
