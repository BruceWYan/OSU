The function in this program takes in an input
and a counter which starts at 0 and returns 1 if 
it is a prime number or 0 if it is not a prime number. 
The function does this by dividing the given integer 
by integers starting from 2 to the half way point
of the given integer. If the remainder of any of the 
divisions is 0, this means that our given integer is 
divisible and is not a prime number.
